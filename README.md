This is my submission for the Dev Jam 2024 hosted by the GDSC club in VIT Vellore

This game is a fight to get fit. The longer you survive the infinite hordes of enemies, the fitter you get. 
The character throws dumbbells at the enemies to damage them. Your job is to run around the map dodging the enemies while the dumbbells take care of them.
The amount of steps you take in real life will directly help you to upgrade your character and survive even longer.

This game is made in Unity using the C# language. All the models and animations have been made in Blender.
The idea behind the game was derived from the constant struggle to stop ourselves from indulging in junk food after seeing the kind of food available in our mess.
